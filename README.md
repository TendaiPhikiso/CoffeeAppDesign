# Coffee App Design

## Summary

This is my first app design. I decided to get out of my comfort zone and try something new. HEY NOW, I know I didn't follow any UX|UI principles, a girl is aware of that... I made the design for fun. Of course, we will improve and create better app designs in the future. But for now, I'm patting myself on the back because...this is ART. #Be your own hype woman. OKAY? Never undervalue your creative work. OKAY? Okay.
